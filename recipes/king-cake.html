            <li>2 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>

            <li>1 tablespoon multicolored candy sprinkles</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and white sugar in warm milk. 
                Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir the egg yolks and melted butter into the milk mixture.
                In a separate bowl, combine the flour, salt, nutmeg and lemon zest.
                Beat the flour mixture into the milk/egg mixture 1 cup at a time.
                When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly 
                floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes. 
                Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to 
                coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place 
                until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, combine the cream cheese and 1/2 cup confectioners' 
                sugar. Mix well. In another small bowl, combine the remaining 2 cups 
                confectioners' sugar, lemon juice and 2 tablespoons milk. 
                Mix well and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Roll the dough out into a 
                6x30 inch rectangle. Spread the cream cheese filling across the center 
                of the dough. Bring the two long edges together and seal completely. 
                Using your hands shape the dough into a long cylinder and place on a 
                greased baking sheet, seam-side down. Shape the dough into a ring press 
                the baby into the ring from the bottom so that it is completely hidden 
                by the dough. Place a well-greased 2 pound metal coffee can the center 
                of the ring to maintain the shape during baking. Cover the ring with a 
                towel and place in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about 45 
                minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. 
                Remove the coffee can and allow the bread to cool. Drizzle 
                cooled cake with lemon/sugar glaze and decorate with candy sprinkles.

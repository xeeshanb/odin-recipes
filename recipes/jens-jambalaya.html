    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My family loves a lot of flavor and spice in our food and jambalaya delivers.
        This is my version of a New Orleans jambalaya that's got a nice kick to it 
        but not overly hot for those whose tongues can't handle it.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons margarine or butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>⅓ cup chopped celery</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped green pepper</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>⅔ cup long grain white rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>⅔ cup diced cooked chicken breast</li>
        <li>⅔ cup cooked crumbled Italian sausage</li>
        <li>⅔ cup peeled cooked shrimp</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt margarine in a large saucepan over medium heat. 
            Stir in onion, celery, and green pepper; cook until softened, 
            about 5 minutes. Pour in diced tomatoes, chicken broth, and rice; 
            season with basil, garlic, pepper, hot sauce, and bay leaf. 
            Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then turn heat to medium-low, 
            cover, and simmer until the rice is done, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the rice has cooked, stir in chicken, sausage, and shrimp. 
            Simmer for a few minutes until heated through. Remove bay leaf before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
